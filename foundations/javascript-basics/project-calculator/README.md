## Overview

The design of this calculator's functionality and style is based on the calculator app found on an iPhone. It was initially a project in the JavaScript Basics section of the Odin Project.

## Features

- Basic math operations: add, subtract, multiply, divide

- Use decimal numbers in calculations

- Clear calculation and restart with a button press

- Displays limited number of digits to the screen and removes any trailing zeros

> To deal with floating number arithmetic issues (ex. `0.1 + 0.2 = 0.30000000000000004`), the number displayed
has the number of digits limited (ex. 12 digits) and then any trailing zeros for decimal numbers are removed
to ultimately display `0.1 + 0.2 = 0.3`. The original number itself is unchanged and used for the next operation.

- Handles dividing by zero

> When the user tries to divide by zero, the output displays `ERROR`. The calculator then expects a new number from the user to divide by instead of zero to continue the previous calculation.

- Keyboard functionality

> Can use keyboard to enter numbers and operators. Equal button on calculator can be clicked with either <kbd>=</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> key.

## TO-DO List

1. Add 'backspace' functionality to undo the last number input.
1. Add plus/minus button to change the sign of the current number (multiply by -1)
1. Add percentage button (divides by 100)
